Hello there ðŸ¤“

You've stumbled upon my personal journey with Nix. For over a year, I've been hacking away on this configuration. It drives my desktop PC, Macbook, and virtual machines in my home lab. Along with syncthing to manage data, this Nix configuration guarantees I have a working, seamless experience across each machine I use. 

While developing this code,  I've done my best to keep it as simple as possible - for both future me and readers like you. You'll see that in how I've organized code, for example, as I keep file naming convetions the same across modules.

You can follow instructions I've listed below, step-by-step, to run your own Nix environment after you have a running Nix install.

# Installation
### NixOS
Check out my [steps for bootstrapping a new virtual machine](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/vm/README.md) that covers building your filesystem, creating the initial config, and saving it all to disk. These steps also work from bare metal.

### MacOS
You must install some depdendencies, which are detailed below. Keep in mind, Nix will create a new volume on your machine to keep the Nix Store, so be prepared to follow through (or have some annoying rollback steps).

# Layout

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ bin          # Simple scripts used to wrap the build
â”œâ”€â”€ common       # Shared configurations applicable to all machines
â”œâ”€â”€ hardware     # Hardware-specific configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ macos        # MacOS and nix-darwin configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ nixos        # My NixOS desktop-related configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ overlays     # Drop an overlay file in this dir, and it runs. So far mainly patches.
â””â”€â”€ vms          # VM-specific configs running in my home-lab
```

# Bootstrap New Computer

## Step 1 - For MacOS, install Nix package manager
Install the nix package manager, add unstable channel:
```sh
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
```
```sh
nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable nixpkgs
```
```sh
nix-channel --update
```

## Step 2 - For NixOS, create a disk partition and install media
Follow this [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/vm/README.md) for instructions to install using `ZFS` or `ext3`.


## Step 3 - Install home-manager
Add the home-manager channel and install it:
```sh
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager
```
```sh
nix-channel --update
```

## Step 4 - If MacOS, install Darwin dependencies
Install Xcode CLI tools and nix-darwin:
```sh
xcode-select --install
```
```sh
nix-build https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/archive/master.tar.gz -A installer
```
```sh
./result/bin/darwin-installer
```

## Step 5 - Build the environment
Download this repo and run:
```sh
./bin/build
```

## Step 6 - Add Yubikey and generate key
Insert Yubikey and generate private keys
```sh
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk
```

## Step 7 - Reboot computer
That's it. You're done.

# Update Computer

## Download the latest updates and update lock file
```sh
nix flake update
```
## Run  build
```sh
./bin/build
```
