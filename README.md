# Dustin's Nix / NixOS config

## Overview
#### Updated: October 27, 2021

These are my "dotfiles" contained within Nix deriviations that drive setup and configuration of my Macbook Pro and home-lab desktop machines.

In a previous life my configuration was driven by [Guix](https://github.com/dustinlyons/guix-config), but with the recent release of Apple Silicon I've decided to seek out better Darwin support.

Enter Nix and NixOS.

## Features

- Simplicity has a top priority; Nix is notoriously confusing so make it easy to understand
- Entirely driven by my single flake.nix
- Supports my M1 Macbook Pro and a NixOS PC at home
- Simple bash scripts to build and switch environments
- Literate configuration style (coming soon!)
