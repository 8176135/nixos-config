# Overview

Hello there!

Welcome to my personal journey with Nix, where I've spent the past year learning and building my own machines and servers. From my M1 Macbook Pro to my NixOS workstation and VMs in my home-lab, I've developed this Nix code with simplicity in mind - for both future me and readers like you. I hope you'll find this true as well.

I was initially drawn to Nix because of its functional operating system and compatibility with both MacOS and x86 PCs. This was important to me, as I use a clunky linux box in my office at home and a Macbook when I'm out and about. I've tried other laptops on the market, including linux-friendly ones like System76, but nothing compares to the quality and performance of the Macbook, especially with the M1/M2 chip.

So Nix, with this amazing property of being both a package manager and an OS, was perfect to manage my machines. And in conjunction with syncthing to help manage state, the result is a seamless, single environment across any device I use.

To get you started, I've included my [steps for bootstrapping a new virtual machine](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/vm/README.md) that also work for a bare metal setup. For MacOS instructions, you'll need to install a few dependencies I've listed below. And if you're new to Emacs, take a look at my [literate configuration](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/common/config/emacs/Emacs.org). I love hacking Emacs and you'll see it's much more than just an IDE. ðŸ¤“

# Bootstrap New Computer

## Step 1 - For MacOS, install Nix package manager
Install the nix package manager, add unstable channel:
```sh
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
```
```sh
nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable nixpkgs
```
```sh
nix-channel --update
```

## Step 2 - For NixOS, create a disk partition and install media
Follow this [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/vm/README.md) for instructions to install using `ZFS` or `ext3`.


## Step 3 - Install home-manager
Add the home-manager channel and install it:
```sh
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager
```
```sh
nix-channel --update
```

## Step 4 - If MacOS, install Darwin dependencies
Install Xcode CLI tools and nix-darwin:
```sh
xcode-select --install
```
```sh
nix-build https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/archive/master.tar.gz -A installer
```
```sh
./result/bin/darwin-installer
```

## Step 5 - Build the environment
Download this repo and run:
```sh
./bin/build
```

## Step 6 - Add Yubikey and generate key
Insert Yubikey and generate private keys
```sh
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk
```

## Step 7 - Reboot computer
That's it. You're done.

# Update Computer

## Download the latest updates and update lock file
```sh
nix flake update
```
## Run  build
```sh
./bin/build
```
