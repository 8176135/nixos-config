# Apps
The apps in this directory are Nix commands, created using the mkApp function within the flake. These commands are tailored for different systems, including Linux (x86_64-linux, aarch64-linux) and Darwin (aarch64-darwin). Each app is essentially a script that performs specific functions related to system configuration and key management.
