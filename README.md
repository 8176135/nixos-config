# Nix for MacOS + NixOS
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/dustinlyons/nixos-config?style=plastic)

_Psst: I can help bring Nix into your company. <a href="https://calendly.com/dustinhlyons/business-intro-call">Get in touch.</a>_

# Overview
Hey, you made it! Welcome. ðŸ¤“ 

This is a Nix flake you can run on MacOS, NixOS, or both at the same time with shared data and configuration. It's also a good example of a MacOS Nix flake.

## Layout
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ bin          # Optional scripts used to run build/update
â”œâ”€â”€ common       # Shared configurations applicable to all systems
â”œâ”€â”€ darwin       # MacOS and nix-darwin configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ nixos        # My NixOS desktop-related configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ overlays     # Drop an overlay file in this dir, and it runs. So far mainly patches.
â””â”€â”€ vms          # VM-specific configs running in my home-lab
```

## Features
- **Same Environment Everywhere**: Easily share config across Linux and Mac with both Nix and Home Manager
- **MacOS Dream Setup**: Fully declarative MacOS, including UI, dock and MacOS App Store apps
- **Bootstrap Nix Command**: Simple `nix-command` to start from zero, both x86 and MacOS platforms
- **Managed Homebrew**: Fully managed, auto-updating homebrew environment with `nix-darwin`
- **Disk Management**: Declarative disk management with Disko, say goodbye to disk utils
- **Secrets Management**: Declarative secrets with agenix for SSH, PGP, syncthing, and other tools
- **Super Fast Emacs**: Bleeding edge Emacs that fixes itself, thanks to a community overlay
- **Nix Flakes**: _Almost_ 100% flake driven, no major use of channels or `configuration.nix`
- **Built In Home Manager**: Home-manager module for seamless configuration (no extra clunky CLI steps)
- **NixOS Environment**: Extensively configured NixOS including clean aesthetic + window animations
- **Nix Overlays**: Auto-loading of Nix overlays: drop a file in a dir and it runs (great for patches!)
- **Declarative Sync**: No-fuss Syncthing: managed keys, certs, and configuration across all platforms
- **Emacs Literate Configuration**: Large Emacs literate configuration to explore (if that's your thing)
- **Simplicity and Readability**: Optimized for simplicity and readability in all cases, not small files everywhere

## For MacOS
### Install dependencies
```sh
xcode-select --install
```
```sh
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
```
```sh
nix run nix-darwin -- switch --flake ~/.config/nix-darwin
```
We still need this for the Home Manager `nix-darwin` module.
```sh
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager
```
```
nix-channel update
```

### Install config
```sh
nix --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' build .#darwinConfigurations.Dustins-MBP.system --impure && \
./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#Dustins-MBP --impure && \
unlink ./result
```

## For NixOS
### Burn the latest ISO
Download and burn [the minimal ISO image](https://nixos.org/download.html).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Nvidia cards, select the second option `nomodeset` when booting the installer.

### Create a private secrets repository
This configuration assumes you have a private `nix-secrets` repository that holds age-encrypted files.

### Install secrets
This configuration assumes you have an Ed25519 public and private key pair, available on a USB drive that has been connected to the system.
```sh
nix run --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' github:dustinlyons/nixos-config#secrets
```

### Install configuration
> [!WARNING]
> Running these commands will reformat your entire drive to the ext4 filesystem.
```sh
nix run --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' github:dustinlyons/nixos-config#install
```

On the first boot at the login screen:
- Use the shortcut `Ctrl-Alt-F2` to move to a terminal session
- Login as root using the password created during installation
- Set the user password with `passwd <user>`
- Go back to the login screen: `Ctrl-Alt-F7`

# Live ISO
Not yet available. Coming soon.

```sh
nix run --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' github:dustinlyons/nixos-config#live
```

# Making changes
You can edit your configuration and save the changes.

## Build and switch to new generation
### On Mac
```sh
nix --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' build .#darwinConfigurations.Dustins-MBP.system --impure && \
./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#Dustins-MBP --impure && \
unlink ./result
```
### On NixOS
```sh
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#felix
```
## Update dependencies
```sh
nix flake update
```
