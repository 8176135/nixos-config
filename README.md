# Dustin's Nix / NixOS config
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/dustinlyons/nixos-config?style=plastic)

# Overview
Hey, you made it! Welcome. ðŸ¤“

You've stumbled upon my personal journey with Nix. For over a year, I've been hacking away at this configuration. Using 100% Nix flakes, this repository drives my office PC, M1 Macbook, and virtual machines in my home lab. Along with syncthing to manage data, this Nix configuration guarantees I have a working, seamless experience across each machine I use. 

Immutable, reproducible infrastructure rocks! It's game-changing and I'll never go back to typing commands in a terminal.

While developing, I've done my best to keep it simple - for both future me and readers like you. You'll see that in how I've organized code, as I keep filename conventions the same across modules. To get you started, I've included step-by-step instructions on bootstrapping a new machine below.

# Features
* Multiple Nix and NixOS configurations, including desktop, laptop, server
* [Step-by-step instructions](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/tree/main#bootstrap-new-computer) to start from zero, both x86 and MacOS platforms
* Fully declarative [MacOS dock](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/darwin/home-manager.nix) and MacOS [App Store apps](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/darwin/home-manager.nix)
* Defined using a [single flake](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/flake.nix) and two targets, not small files spread across collections of modules
* Fully managed, auto-updating [homebrew](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/darwin/home-manager.nix) environment
* Easily [share](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/tree/main/common) config across Linux and Mac with both Nix and Home Manager
* Minimal [shell scripts](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/tree/main/bin) covering basic functions for running systems
* Bleeding edge Emacs that fixes itself, thanks to a community [overlay](https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay)
* Extensively configured NixOS environment including clean aesthetic + [window animations](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/nixos/default.nix)
* Auto-loading of Nix [overlays](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/tree/main/overlays): drop a file in a dir and it runs _(great for patches!)_
* Large Emacs [literate configuration](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/common/config/emacs/config.org) to explore (if that's your thing)
* Optimized for simplicity and readability in all cases

### Coming Soon
* âœ… ~Persistence defined under [XDG](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) ([#5](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/issues/5))~
* Opt-in persistence using [impermanence](https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence) and `zfs` snapshot reset ([#8](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/issues/8))
* Secrets managed with `sops-nix` ([#6](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/issues/6))

# Bootstrap New Computer

## For MacOS, install Nix package manager and dependencies
```sh
xcode-select --install
```
```sh
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
```
```sh
nix run nix-darwin -- switch --flake ~/.config/nix-darwin
```

## For NixOS, create a disk partition and install media
Follow this [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config/blob/main/vm/README.md) for instructions to install using `ZFS` or `ext3`.

## How to build the environment
```sh
./bin/build
```

## How to update the environment
```sh
nix flake update
```
```sh
./bin/update
```
